### Please read this file for understading the structure of this project ###

## Internship Project Main Folder
                                                        
1. Template - Folder of each module contains Html files and code for Simulation of that model.
2. Static - Folder of each module contains images and javascript codes for pretest and other related files for that model.


## Apart from above folders, Main Intenship Project Folder has two html files
1. Index.html - It has code of front page.
2. AboutUs.html - It has code for about us page.


## Now, Each module contains 6 HTML files
1. Aim - Specify Aim of experiment and Developer of the model.
2. Theory - Gives theoretical knowledge of Model
3. Pretest - It checks your current knowledge about model
4. Simulation - Working models or shown how to run them yourself
5. Post-Test - It is used to check whether you have correctly understood the model or its implementation
6. References - It has all the references which are used by developers for developing the module.


## Advantages of code:
1. All HTMl code is separated from other files, so it is very easy to change it to flask structure.
2. Well documented and clean codes.

## Problems:
1. Redundant codes of navbar, sidebar menu in each file of each module makes updation in any file difficult.
